# Python Data Science Assignment

## 1) Base Identifying Information

This was completed in a Jupyter Notebook environment!

Main: Consists of main1.ipynb, the 3 plots, original data, and cleaned data.

Part 1: Consists of MNIST-Starter.ipynb (this is modified to create MNIST-Complete), MNIST.h5 (the model), and a report.

## 2) Dataset

The dataset I used can be found here: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/geomack/spotifyclassification>

## 3) Evidence for rights to dataset

The dataset is public and has an unknown license. Thus we can
assume that it assume that it is fine to use for personal projects.

## 4) Requirements

This dataset consist of these numerical columns:

* *Acousticness*
* *Danceability*
* *Duration_ms*
* *Energy*
* *Instrumentalness (the amount of vocals in a song. Closer to 1.0 means audio is more instrumental)*
* *Key*
* *Liveness (the probability the song was recorded with a live audience)*
* *Loudness*
* *Mode*
* *Speechiness*
* *Tempo*
* *Time_signature*
* *Valence (how positive the music sounds)*
* *Target*

And these non-numerical columns:

* *Song Title*
* *Artist*

There are 2017 rows in total. No rows or data needed to be removed or cleaned.
